[00:00.76] Sugar, sugar
[00:04.93] Hmm
[00:06.43] 
[00:16.64] Ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:22.14] 
[00:35.14] She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
[00:39.82] He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
[00:43.77] His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
[00:48.18] Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?
[01:13.18] 
[00:52.00] If you want my body and ya think I'm sexy
[00:56.44] Come on, sugar, let me know, ooh
[01:00.60] If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
[01:04.97] Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh (tell me so, baby)
[01:29.97] 
[01:26.66] He's acting shy, looking for an answer
[01:31.07] Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
[01:34.87] Now hold on a minute before we go much further
[01:39.43] Give me a dime, so I can phone my mother
[01:44.00] They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
[01:47.83] At last, he can tell her exactly what his heart meant
[02:14.33] 
[01:52.00] If you want my body and ya think I'm sexy
[01:56.42] Come on, honey, tell me so
[02:00.73] If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
[02:05.24] Come on, sugar, let me know, aw
[02:20.74] 
[02:26.84] His heart's beating like a drum
[02:30.71] 'Cause at last he's got this girl home
[02:35.56] Relax, baby, now we are all alone, aw
[02:54.06] 
[03:27.18] They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
[03:31.66] Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
[03:35.69] Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
[03:40.47] They got each other, neither one's complaining
[03:44.65] He says, "I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee"
[03:48.68] "Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie"
[04:13.18] 
[03:52.74] If you want my body and ya think I'm sexy
[03:57.12] Come on, sugar, let me know
[04:01.52] If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
[04:05.58] Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh-ooh
[04:23.08] 
[04:27.77] If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
[04:31.74] Come on, sugar, let me know
[04:36.26] If you really, really, really, really need me
[04:41.86] Just let me know
[04:49.86] 
[04:44.74] Just reach out and touch me, hoo
[04:52.90] If you really want me
[04:55.26] Just reach out and touch me
[04:57.21] Come on, sugar, let me know
[05:10.71] 
[05:01.77] If you really need me
[05:03.43] Ju-ju-just reach out and touch me
[05:05.78] Come on, sugar, let me know
[05:09.61] If you, if you, if you really need me
[05:14.15] Just come on and tell me so, ooh-ooh
[05:22.62] Just reach out and tell me so, ooh baby
